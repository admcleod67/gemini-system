# Project milestones

This document is an **orienting roadmap**. Priorities and scope may change as the Gemini System evolves.

## Milestone 1 — Core System (completed)

Roughly reflects what exists in the tree today:

- Minimal TCL shell
- Filesystem with directory-per-file and record blobs
- Line-oriented editor (system `EDIT` / `ED>` workflow, delegated from BASIC)
- BASIC compiler and runtime
- VOC resolver and command lookup
- Ability to run BASIC programs end-to-end

## Milestone 2 — Multi-account (single session): catalogue, account context & dictionary model

**Goal:** Add a Pick-authentic **session** and **account** model on top of the existing core. **Accounts** are first-class: each session has one **current account** (Pick root, MD/VOC bindings, and runtime state). **Distinct user identities** (separate from account, `USERS` catalogue, default-account selection) are **out of scope** for the delivered Milestone 2 path and remain roadmap. **No concurrency or locking**—one active session per process is acceptable for this milestone.

The host hands **`PickCore::UserSession`** into userland; today **`username`** and **`accountName`** mirror the **account id** until a real user catalogue exists.

**Catalogue & host layout**

- **`ACCOUNTS` catalogue (host-backed, e.g. JSON):** Maps account names to host directories (account → Pick root / VOC path). This is what **console `LOGON`** uses today; see **`docs/gemini-bootstrap.md`**.
- **Per-account directory layout:** Under the catalogue, e.g. `gemini/accounts/<ACCOUNT>/` with **`MD`** and **`VOC`** (and minimal structure for command lookup).
- **`MD` / `VOC`:** Pick-style **attribute-per-line** text (not ad hoc blobs), with a **minimal MD/VOC structure per account** suitable for bootstrapping that account.
- **`USERS` catalogue (deferred):** Pick-style records (username, password hash, default account, privileges) and host-backed JSON (`USERS.json`) remain the **target** model; optional attachment for boot messaging may exist, but **logon does not depend on it** until user–account separation is implemented.

**Pointers & command resolution**

- **Full pointer semantics** where applicable for this milestone: **V, Q, D, A, X** (consistent with Pick dictionary behaviour).
- **TCL command resolution through VOC**—authentic Pick-style lookup (not a parallel shortcut resolver).

**Session model**

- Per-session state includes at least: **current account** (Pick root), **current VOC** (and MD binding), **default file pointers**, **TCL environment**, and **BASIC runtime state**.
- **Session system fields** (read-only, session-backed): **`@USERNO`**, **`@ACCOUNT`**, **`@LOGNAME`**—aligned with Tcl/PROC/BASIC and catalogue logon. Further Pick-style bindings (**`@TTY`**, **`@PRIVILEGES`**, and richer MD-derived state) remain **stretch** targets for this milestone.

**Operator-facing flow**

- **Core boot:** **`PickCore::BootMonitor`** cold-start output, then catalogue **`LOGON`** (**`PickCore::LoginService::runCatalogLogin`**, **account id** only, optional **`MD,AUTO-LOGON`** / env auto-logon) in **`main`**—not inside the Tcl REPL. Tcl starts only after **`Shell::attachUserSession`** receives a **`UserSession`**. **`stdout`** cadence (interactive **`LOGON PLEASE:`** vs auto-logon **`endl`** behaviour, blank line before the Tcl banner) is spelled out under **`docs/gemini-bootstrap.md`**; **`runTclRepl`** has **no** leading newline.
- **`LOGTO`:** Switch account within an existing Tcl session, reload Pick root / MD/VOC context, reset session state for the new account.
- **`WHO`** and **`LOGOFF`:** Minimal introspection and clean session teardown; **`LOGOFF`** returns the host to the core **`LOGON`** phase (**no nested Tcl login loop**).

## Milestone 3 — TCL & filesystem maturation

- Additional TCL verbs beyond the Milestone 1 set (e.g. catalog/maintenance commands not covered today—distinct from existing **`LIST`** *file*, **`LIST-FILES`**, **`LIST-PROGRAMS`**, **`DELETE-FILE`**, …)
- Improved `READ` / `WRITE` behaviour
- Editor refinements
- Resolver introspection commands
- Early groundwork for attribute-aware records (no format changes yet)

## Milestone 4 — R83-flavoured fidelity pass

- Improved TCL ergonomics
- Optional quoting and tokenisation refinements
- VOC authoring from within the system
- BASIC and PROC polish
- Decision on long-term VOC format (canonical, structured, or hybrid)
